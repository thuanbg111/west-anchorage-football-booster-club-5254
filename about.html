  <h1>About West Anchorage Football Booster Club</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>West Anchorage Football Booster Club</strong> is a U.S. <strong>501(c)(3)</strong> public charity (EIN: 10335254)
    dedicated to strengthening neighborhoods through access to essential services, safe spaces,
    and long-term support. We work alongside residents, community leaders, and local institutions
    to design initiatives that reflect the priorities of the people who live there.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our models are intentionally practical. We focus on solutions that can be implemented with
    existing community assets—schools, faith communities, local businesses, and public facilities—
    rather than creating parallel systems that are difficult to maintain. Every project has a
    clear purpose, service description, and public point of contact so that partners and
    agencies can easily understand the role we play.

  <h2>What Guides Our Work</h2>
  <div class="zig">
    <div>
      <h3>Listening first</h3>
      <p>
        Before new programs are launched, we spend time listening to residents, frontline staff,
        and local organizations. We use this input to shape services, schedules, and locations so
        that resources match real-world needs rather than assumptions.
      </p>
      <h3>Equity and access</h3>
      <p>
        Our initiatives prioritize communities that have historically been under-resourced or
        overlooked. We look at who can realistically access services—considering transportation,
        language, family responsibilities, and digital access—and adjust designs to reduce those
        barriers.
      </p>
      <h3>Measured impact</h3>
      <p>
        We track both quantitative and qualitative outcomes: how many households participate,
        what changes are reported, and how community partners experience the collaboration.
        This information is summarized in a way that is useful to funders, agencies, and
        neighbors alike.
